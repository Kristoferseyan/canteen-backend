# Canteen Backend (CanteenWebApi)  

## **Overview**  
The **Canteen Backend** is the API powering the **Canteen Application**, delivering core services for user authentication, order processing, and inventory management. Built with **ASP.NET Core Web API**, it efficiently handles all data transactions while seamlessly integrating with **SQL Server**.

This repository represents my first venture into backend API development as part of my on-the-job training (OJT). It demonstrates the integration capabilities between a **Flutter frontend** and an **ASP.NET backend** while serving as a proposal project for my host company to digitize canteen operations.

The project showcases my learning journey in building production-ready APIs and database architecture, contributing to a complete end-to-end solution for modern food service management. 

## **Features**  
- **User Authentication** â€“ Secure login, registration, and role-based access control.  
- **Order Management** â€“ Process, update, and track food orders in real time.  
- **Inventory Management** â€“ Manage menu items, stock levels, and featured products.  
- **Admin Controls** â€“ Assign roles, monitor activity, and manage user access.  
- **Database Integration** â€“ Efficient data storage and retrieval using **SQL Server**.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **ASP.NET Core** â€“ Backend framework for API development.  
- **Entity Framework Core** â€“ ORM for database management.  
- **SQL Server** â€“ Relational database for storing user and order data.  
- **Azure Data Studio** â€“ Database management tool.  

## **Development Status**
